# OSIC-Pulmonary-Fibrosis-Progression-Notebook

## Introduction
This is an entry to the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression), in which competitors were asked to predict the severity of lung function decline based on image data (CT scans of the lung), metadata (age, smoking status, sex, time of CT scan) and baseline FVC. 
This entry was done as a group with 3 other members. There were multitudes of different solutions that we tried such as various combinations of machine learning techniques and pre-processing but one of the simpler solutions performed the best for us in the end.

## Files
`lin_reg.py` - predicts the FVC and produces a formatted .csv relevant to the competition. <br>
`tabdata.ipynb` - a file that presents some of my initial data exploration.
