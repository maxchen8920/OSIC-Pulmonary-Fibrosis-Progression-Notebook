# OSIC-Pulmonary-Fibrosis-Progression-Notebook

## Introduction
This is an entry to the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression), in which competitors were asked to predict the severity of lung function decline based on image data (CT scans of the lung), metadata (age, smoking status, sex, time of CT scan) and baseline FVC.

## Files
'lin_reg.py' - predicts the FVC and produces a formatted .csv relevant to the competition.
'tabdata.ipynb' - a file that presents some of my initial data exploration.
